Libraries complement RosaeNLG's core features.

For instance the xref:countries.adoc[countries] library generates names of countries (`le Royaume-Uni`, `the United Kingdom` etc.).

Libraries are packaged as npm modules. They usually contain JavaScript and Pug code that must be included in your project.

Installation and Usage are described for `rosaenlg-countries`.

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
npm install rosaenlg-countries

TIP: You might have to adapt the path. In the example, templates are in a folder sibling from `node_modules`.
