= Boilerplate project

link:https://github.com/RosaeNLG/rosaenlg-boilerplate[boilerplate project] is a standard NLG project using RosaeNLG and following (my) best practices that you can fork to start your own RosaeNLG project.

It is based on the content of the English tutorial.


== Generating texts

Just use `gulp texts` to generate the texts in `dist` folder.


== Data load and pre processing

At some point you have to load into data and also pre process it. You can use `init.js` for that.


== Templates organisation

One possible organization for your templates:

* `phoneForHtml.pug` and `phoneForJson.pug` are technical entrypoints: they are almost the same, and mainly call the `phone` mixin
* `includes.pug` centralizes all your includes: this is handy when you refactor
* `phones.pug` is the real entrypoint for NLG: it generates the text for a phone
* `phone_refexpr.pug` contains the reference and referring expressions for phones. Create one file per object you describe (`car_refexpr.pug`) etc.
* sentences (most of the textual content) are in `sentences`:
** one file per sentence: `colors.pug` generates the sentence about the colors, `intro.pug` is the introduction sentence etc.
** If you have longer sentences and paragraphs you should create a more sophisticated hierarchy, but *I recommend to keep 1 file per sentence*.


== Testing

You should (really) have some regression testing on your texts. It just compares texts with reference texts previously generated. 

* Use `gulp nonreg` to regenerate the reference file in `tests/phonesNonreg.json`. It contains texts along with the random seed (the same random seed has to be used when running the tests).
* Run the tests using `npm run test` or `mocha`
