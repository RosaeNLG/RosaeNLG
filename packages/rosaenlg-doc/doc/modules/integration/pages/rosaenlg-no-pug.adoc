= Usage without templates (using low level API)

For some very specific usages you may wish to directly code the language generation using JavaScript code, making low level calls to RosaeNLG underlying API - completely bypassing Pug and the templates mechanisms.

Instead of writing Pug templates that get transpiled into JavaScript code, you will directly write this low level JavaScript code.
Some NLG products, like CoreNLG or SimpleNLG, only work like that.

Be aware that:

* support on RosaeNLG is very experimental
* API is subject to change in the future
* some features might not be available
* generating large texts will be tedious to code and to maintain

See some simple examples in `rosaenlg-no-pug`, `test.js` file.
