= Client side in browser rendering

The idea is to generate texts client side, _in a browser_, _without node.js_.

A use case is for business intelligence application, where charts are generated on the fly dynamically in the browser, and with RosaeNLG one could do the same for texts.

== Limits

Generating texts in the browser works perfectly. There are 2 limitations to be aware of:

* The default bundled packages per language do not contain most of their linguistic resources to make them lighter. The linguistic resources have to be bundled inside it at compile time: the ones which are effectively used in templates are collected automatically during compilation, and you can also indicate expressly the other ones.
* The xref:mixins_ref:value_simplified_syntax.adoc[simplified syntax] `<...>` is desactivated for `fr_FR`, `de_DE` and `it_IT`: you cannot use it in your templates when doing client side rendering in those languages. The reason is that this feature requires `lefff-helper` module (for French), `german-dict-helper` (for German), and `morph-it-helper` for Italian and that they require resource files that would be too large to run in a browser.


== How to make it work

A possible pipeline is the following:

* compile your templates using `compileFileClient` (put `embedResources` to true)
* package them using `browserify`
* import the compiled template and the proper `rosaenlg_*_*.js` lib in your webpage
* generate texts in your webpage just calling the template

TIP: You should use `rosaenlg-packager` to ease the two first steps.

In your html file, import the proper packages. `rosaenlg_tiny_en_US_VERSION.js` is the compiled and packaged template.
[source,html]
....
<script src="compiled_en_US.js"></script>
<script src="rosaenlg_tiny_en_US_0.18.9.js"></script>
....

You can also use a CDN: https://unpkg.com/rosaenlg@VERSION/dist/rollup/rosaenlg_tiny_LANG_VERSION_comp.js, for instance https://unpkg.com/rosaenlg@1.20.2/dist/rollup/rosaenlg_tiny_en_US_1.20.2_comp.js

In your html file, run this JavaScript to generate texts:
[source,javascript]
....
let rendered = template({
  util: new rosaenlg_en_US.NlgLib({language: 'en_US'}),
  data: ...
});
....
`template` is the name of the function rendering the compiled template; it an option when calling `rosaenlg-packager`.

TIP: For a complete technical POC that effectively generates texts in a browser using RosaeNLG, see  `rosaenlg-browser-poc` module.

== Bundling linguistic resources

Linguistic resources (extensive lists of verbs, words, adjectives) are not bundled directly inside the packaged versions for browsers: if they were, the packages would be too large to be transfered to a browser. Moreover, a project typically only uses effectively a few verbs/words/adjectives among the whole available list.

To bundle linguistic resources:

* When *compiling*, you *must* provide the `language` parameter. While you generally don't have to indicate language at compile time, here it is necessary so that RosaeNLG knows how to resolve resources to bundle them.
* When *compiling*, you *must* set `embedResources` to true so that RosaeNLG knows it must embed resources in the compiled template.
* Some/most of the verbs/words/adjectives are properly detected at compile time and properly embedded automatically. For instance in `#[+verb(..., {'verb' : 'danser', tense:'FUTUR'} )]`, _danser_ will be detected.
* For the verbs/words/adjectives which are not properly detected (for instance in `#[+verb(..., getVerbXXX() )]` - and you will see it at runtime when rendering fails), you can explicitly indicate the resources to embed. Use `verbs`, `words`, `adjectives` parameters in the compile options; all of them are lists

TIP: For undetected resources, you can as well add a dummy mixin where resources will be properly detected:
....
mixin forResourcesOnly
  //- will add all words and verbs and adjectives (but don't call the génie!)
  | #[+subjectVerbAdj(['lampe', 'génie'], ['sembler', 'voir'], ['somptueux', 'beau'])]
....

.Linguistic resources which can be bundled per language
[options="header"]
|=======================================
| Language | Linguistic resources
| `en_US` | verbs, words
| `fr_FR` | verbs, words, adjectives
| `de_DE` | verbs, words, adjectives
| `it_IT` | verbs, words, adjectives
| `es_ES` | verbs, words, adjectives
|=======================================

A complete example in French:
[source,javascript]
....
const templateVerb = `
p
  | il #[+verb(getAnonMS(), {verb: 'chanter', tense:'FUTUR'} )]
`;

const compiled = rosaenlgPug.compileClient(templateVerb, {
  language: 'fr_FR',
  compileDebug: false,
  embedResources: true
});

const compiledFct = new Function('params', `${compiled}; return template(params);`);

let rendered = compiledFct({
  util: new NlgLib({language: 'fr_FR'})
});
....
will output _il chante_, without requiring any linguistic resource at runtime.

TIP: When a resource has been forgotten, execution will fail; watch for logs as they should indicate the exact name of the forgotten resource (e.g. `could not read xxxx on disk: ...`).

TIP: Auxiliary verbs (_être_ and _avoir_ for French, _sein_, _haben_ and _werden_ for German) are always automatically included.
