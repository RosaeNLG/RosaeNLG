= Referring Expressions

== Simple example

In a specific text you often make a reference to the same thing again and again. Often it is the main thing you talk about: a hotel when you describe hotels, a financial fund if you ever want to talk about a financial fund, etc. But you won't want to mention it again and again using the same words:

_*The ring* is made of gold. *The ring* has one diamond. *The ring* can be used to rule them all._

You would prefer:

_*The ring* is made of gold. *This jewel* has one diamond. *It* can be used to rule them all._

So we would wish to configure:

. How to mention the object the first time we talk about it (here *the ring*): this is called the _reference_.
. How to mention it afterwards (here *this jewel*, *it*, etc.): this is called a _referring expression_. 

Referring expression generation is a classic and complex topic in NLG, but we will keep it very simple.

This is how to define references and referring expressions. We assume that you have a js object called PRODUCT.
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- var PRODUCT = {};
- PRODUCT.ref = 'PRODUCT_ref';
mixin PRODUCT_ref(obj, params)
  | the ring

- PRODUCT.refexpr = 'PRODUCT_refexpr'
mixin PRODUCT_refexpr(obj, params)
  synz
    syn
      | this jewel
    syn
      | it
p #[+value(PRODUCT)]  / #[+value(PRODUCT)] / #[+value(PRODUCT)] / #[+value(PRODUCT)]
`, 'he ring / '
);
</script>
++++


In the signature of the re/ref mixins:

* `obj` is the object itself (here `PRODUCT`)
* `params` are additional parameters

Then you just trigger the reference or a referring expression using the `value` mixin. The system automatically chooses when to trigger the reference and when to trigger a referring expression.
....
p #[+value(PRODUCT)]  / #[+value(PRODUCT)] / #[+value(PRODUCT)] / #[+value(PRODUCT)]
....
This will output _the ring / it / this jewel / it_ (referring expressions are randomly choosen here).


== Other mixins using Reference and Referring expressions

The `value` mixin is a direct way to trigger them. But other mixins also use this mechanism:

* `thirdPossession(THE_DIAMONDS, 'color')` will output `the color of the diamonds` or `their color`
* `subjectVerb` and `subjectVerbAdj`: for instance, `+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine')` will output `the ring shines` or `it shines`.

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- var PRODUCT = {};
- PRODUCT.ref = 'PRODUCT_ref';
mixin PRODUCT_ref(obj, params)
  | the ring

- PRODUCT.refexpr = 'PRODUCT_refexpr'
mixin PRODUCT_refexpr(obj, params)
  synz
    syn
      | this jewel
    syn
      | it

p #[+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine')]  / #[+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine')] / #[+subjectVerb(PRODUCT, 'shine')]
`, 'The ring shines / '
);
</script>
++++

== Force representant & reset

Sometimes you just want to force which representation to use (reference or referring expression) at a specific place.

* `#[+value(PRODUCT, {REPRESENTANT: 'ref'})]` will force the representant representation.
* `#[+value(PRODUCT, {REPRESENTANT: 'refexpr'})]` will force the referring expression representation.

Sometimes you also whish to reset the representant back to its reference.
This is often done when changing paragraph or section in a same document.
....
- resetRep(PRODUCT)
....

== Referring expressions and gender/number

In English you don't care about the gender of an object. But you do care about its number. For instance, let's talk about earrings:

* Representant will be `earrings`.
* Referring expressions will be `these earrings` or `this jewel`

This issue is that the agreement of the verb depends of the chosen referring expression: _These earrings *are* beautiful_ / _This jewel *is* beautiful_.
In some languages like French you have to care for both gender and number.

To deal with this just mention the gender and/or the number each time a reference or a referring expression is triggered.
Default gender is masculine and default number is singular.

=== Setting explicitely the number

++++
<script>
spawnEditor('en_US', 
`- var PRODUCT = {};
- PRODUCT.ref = 'PRODUCT_ref';
mixin PRODUCT_ref(obj, params)
  | the earrings
  - setRefNumber(PRODUCT, 'P');

- PRODUCT.refexpr = 'PRODUCT_refexpr'
mixin PRODUCT_refexpr(obj, params)
  synz
    syn
      | these earrings
      - setRefNumber(PRODUCT, 'P');
    syn
      | this jewel
      - setRefNumber(PRODUCT, 'S');

p #[+value(PRODUCT)]  / #[+value(PRODUCT)] / #[+value(PRODUCT)] / #[+value(PRODUCT)]
`, 'The earrings / '
);
</script>
++++

TIP: You can have fun and trigger _it_ or _they_ as a referring expression depending on the current number of the object.

=== Setting the gender

Use `setRefGender` to change the gender:

* Accepts a direct gender value: M/F for French, M/F/N for German.
* Or, in French, German, Italian and Spanish, a word: the gender will be lookup in the dictionnary.
* Or, in French, German, Italian and Spanish, `#[+value('bague', {represents: PRODUIT})]` will output _bague_ *and* set the gender of `PRODUIT` to `F` via the dictionnary.

You can use some syntactic sugar to simplify the structures. An example in German:
++++
<script>
spawnEditor('de_DE', 
`- var PRODUKT2 = {};

- PRODUKT2.ref = 'produkt2_ref';
mixin produkt2_ref(obj, params)
  | #[+value( 'Telefon', addToParams({represents: PRODUKT2, det:'DEFINITE'}))]

- PRODUKT2.refexpr = 'produkt2_refexpr'
mixin produkt2_refexpr(obj, params)
  | #[+value(['Handy','Gurke','Telefon'], addToParams({represents: PRODUKT2, 'det': syn_fct(['DEFINITE','DEMONSTRATIVE'])}))]

p #[+value(PRODUKT2)]  / #[+value(PRODUKT2)] / #[+value(PRODUKT2)] / #[+value(PRODUKT2)]
`
);
</script>
++++

Will output:

* if case is `NOMINATIVE`: _das Telefon / diese Gurke / diese Gurke / dieses Handy / dieses Handy etc._
* if case is `GENITIVE`: _des Telefons / dieser Gurke / dieses Telefons / des Telefons / dieser Gurke etc._

TIP: `addToParams` is a shortcut that completes the `params` parameter (it has to have that exact name) with more properties. Behind the scenes it is just an `Object.assign` call. Use it often!


== Getting information about the next representant

aka predicting the future.

Sometimes you need to know what the next reference will be, especially its characteristics (gender, number, referential or referring expression), but without actually triggering it. This is useful:

* In some languages like French where you have to agree with something that will only appear later: in _*Fabriquées* en or, *les boucles d'oreilles*_, *Fabriquées* agrees with *boucles d'oreilles*, even if *boucles d'oreilles* is only output after it.
* Internally for mixins like `thirdPossession(THE_DIAMONDS, 'color')` which can  output `the color of the diamonds` or `their color`: when they output `the color of`, they already know that the next representant is the reference.

The js function `getNextRep(obj)` will give you an object containing properties of the next representant. On this object functions like `getRefGender` or `getRefNumber` will work. Still most of the time you may use it as it in a `agreeAdj` mixin:
....
#[+agreeAdj('fabriqué', getNextRep(PRODUIT))]
....
