_how, in practice, develop RosaeNLG templates efficiently_


== Large projects, using VSCode

_This setup is recommended when you develop a serious, potentially large NLG project._

=== Initial setup

* use VSCode as it has syntax highlighting for Pug - which is 90% the same as RosaeNLG syntax
* fork the link:https://github.com/RosaeNLG/rosaenlg-boilerplate[boilerplate project]
* run `npm install`


=== Develop

* open a terminal within VSCode
* in that terminal run `npx rosaenlg-cli -l fr_FR -w templates\phoneCli.pug`
* just modify a template, save, and the result will be rendered in real time in the terminal

The `phoneCli.pug` template contains sample data: this is practical for development and debug, but that's all: your real data should no stay in templates.


=== Render

* just use `gulp texts` to render texts in an HTML file
* adapt to generate a JSON file or whatever


=== Deploy to use as an API

* create a xref:integration:node-server.adoc[RosaeNLG server] somewhere, AWS etc. with docker: `docker run -p 80:5000 -i rosaenlg/server:latest`
* run `gulp package` to get your packaged template in `dist/`
* push your template to your server using the API: `POST` on `/templates`
* render: `POST` to `/templates/phones/SHA1/render` - where SHA1 comes from the response in the first API

Alternatively, you can use a preconfigured hosted API link:https://rapidapi.com/ludan/api/rosaenlg1[Rapid API].

Also, you can build a new docker image each time in top of `rosaenlg/server:latest`, just adding the JSON files in the proper folder.


== Very small projects

_When you develop very short templates: one sigle sentence, or a few sentences_


=== Develop

*Develop* directly in the browser using the link:https://rosaenlg.org/ide/index.html[browser IDE]:

* Put your test data directly in the template
* Render your test texts directly in the browser

WARNING: Save regularly on your local computer using the "Save" button.

When using the same template to render production texts, you will need to pass real data, and not just render the test data. Use this kind of structure:

[source,javascript]
....
-
  let phones_default = [
    {
      name: 'OnePlus 5T',
      colors: ['Black', 'Red', 'White'],
    }

-
  if (!phones) { // if not provided in the API we take default values for tests
    phones = phones_default;
  }
....

See `tutorial for API, with external data option` example in the en_US browser IDE.


=== Package

*Package* using the "Package" button. Save the packaged JSON file locally. It contains a ready to deploy version of your templates.


=== Render

*Render* using a RosaeNLG API. A hosted version is available at link:https://rapidapi.com/ludan/api/rosaenlg1[Rapid API], and it is free to use for low volumes:

* first push the packaged template using cURL or Postman to the `/templates` endpoint
* then render using the `/templates/templateId/templateSha1/render` endpoint

See https://rosaenlg.org/openapi/redoc-static_node.html[swagger here].

Exemple of render request:
[source,json]
....
{
    "language": "en_US",
    "phones": [
        {
            "name": "OnePlus 35T",
            "colors": [
                "White"
            ],
            "displaySize": 6,
            "screenRatio": 99,
            "battery": 5500
        }
    ]
}
....
