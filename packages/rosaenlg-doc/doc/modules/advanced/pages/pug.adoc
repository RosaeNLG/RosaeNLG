= Pug & Why pug

A classic templating engine is a good basis to build a NLG system (at least for template-based NLG systems). It brings the ability to easily build html/xml structures, which is handy even when doing NLG, and brings out of the box features like conditions, switch/case etc. which are essential too in a NLG system.

https://pugjs.org/[Pug] is a templating engine designed for node or browser execution. It is fast, robust and feature-rich - and I like the syntax.

Thus RosaeNLG is based on pug.

*RosaeNLG templates are basically pug templates where you use RosaeNLG structures and mixins to complete the standard pug syntax.*

RosaeNLG templates make a heavy use of those pug structures:

* if / else
* case / when
* mixins
* inline JavaScript (with `-`)

Also, there is generally not that much html/xml structure in NLG templates; texts are rather produced as a flow, which means that a you RosaeNLG templates will make a heavy use of `|` and often look like that:
....
  | #[+callAMixin] bla
  | some text
  | #[+callAnotherMixin] etc.
....
