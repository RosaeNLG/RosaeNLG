RosaeNLG consists of some specific Pug mixins with some algorithms in the background.

It generates texts in 2 distinct steps:

. A first output is generated via the xref:pug.adoc[standard Pug rendering system].
. This output is cleaned for proper punctuation: xref:filter.adoc[filter mechanism].
