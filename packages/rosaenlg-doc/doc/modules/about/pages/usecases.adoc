= What are the usecases for NLG

NLG automates the production of repetitive reports and texts based on structured data. For instance:

* describe a product and its features based on its characteristics
* produce structured reports in the banking/financial industry e.g. risk reports, financial fund performance
* summarize situations e.g. preparation to meeting, meeting minutes
* generate personalized emails
* generate training data for NLU and chatbots
