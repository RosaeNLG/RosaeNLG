# RosaeNLG Community

## Monthly Community Event

Once a month, a virtual 1 hour event is organized:

- an external speaker presents 1 RosaeNLG use case or 1 specific RosaeNLG topic
- news highlight on what happened on RosaeNLG during last month (both on the product and on the community)
- what is expected next month
- Q&A
- call for next month external speaker

Events are visible on [RosaeNLG meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/rosaenlg/). Speakers are most welcome - you can contact through meetup.

Meetings occur the the first Friday of each month:

- Thursday 7th of January 2021
- Thursday 4th of February 2021
- Thursday 4th of March 2021
etc.

The time of the meeting changes every month:

- 18:00 CET January / March etc. - which is friendly for Europe and the US.
- 9:00 CET February / April etc. - which is friendlier for Russia and Asia.

Events are made using Microsoft Teams.
