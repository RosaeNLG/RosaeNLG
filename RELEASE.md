# Versioning, Releases

RosaeNLG follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- a new patch version is published usually once or twice a month to update third party libraries
- new versions often mix third party library patches, debug, and evolutions
- new versions are published whenever the code is ready (release often mindset)
- new versions are available at the same time as source code on GitHub (on a dedicated version branch), on npm, and on docker hub
- only the last version is maintained (see [Supported Versions](SECURITY.md#supported-versions))
